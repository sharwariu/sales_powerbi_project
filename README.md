The sales dashboard created using Power BI provides a comprehensive overview of sales data sourced from Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, multi-model database service provided by Microsoft. The dashboard allows users to gain insights into sales data in real-time, using interactive visualizations that provide an intuitive view of the data.

The main dashboard page includes several key charts and graphs that provide a summary of sales data over time, as well as a breakdown of sales by region or product category. The charts are interactive, allowing users to explore the data in greater detail by drilling down into specific time periods, products, or regions of interest.

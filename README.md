The sales dashboard created using Power BI provides a clear and concise overview of sales data in a visually appealing format. The data for the dashboard is sourced from an Excel spreadsheet, which is connected to Power BI to create the interactive dashboard.

The dashboard includes several key elements that allow the user to quickly understand the sales data. The main dashboard page displays a series of charts and graphs that summarize the sales data over time, including monthly and yearly sales figures, as well as a breakdown of sales by product category.

The dashboard also includes interactive elements, such as slicers, which allow the user to filter the data by product, region, or other variables of interest. The user can select specific time periods, products, or regions to focus on and see how sales have changed over time or across different categories.

In addition to the main dashboard page, there are several other pages that provide additional detail on specific aspects of the sales data. These pages include tables and charts that show detailed information on individual products, sales by region, or other relevant metrics.

Overall, the sales dashboard provides a user-friendly and accessible way to explore and analyze sales data. By using Power BI to connect to Excel data, the dashboard can be easily updated with new data as it becomes available, ensuring that the user always has access to the most current sales information.
